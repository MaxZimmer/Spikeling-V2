# Spikeling V 2.0

### To be modified for V 2.1

- RGB LED

      The soldered LEDs have common anode and therefore do not correspond to the PCB schematics (common cathode).

      The PCB footprint is as follow: GND, R, G, B (may consider changing for R, GND, G, B which is more common)

      The LEDs G and B should have their own analog pin and not be dependent of the buzzer digital pin.
